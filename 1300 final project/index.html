                        The Chartered bus between Cornell University and Philadelphia is available for five school breaks as a collaborative effort of Cornell Parents of Greater Philadelphia for transporting students to and from Cornell University in Ithaca, New York and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. Pooled resources are used to charter a bus specifically for the services outlined on this website. As such, this website is provided as a means to facilitate the organization of this service which is offered for the five breaks during the school year as listed in the Bus Schedule Section.

The carrier will not turn you back but will try to accommodate to the situation.

            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions (FAQs)</h2>
                <p class="divider-line">____________________________________________________</p>
                <p><strong>What is the cost of a trip?</strong></p>
                <p>The cost of the trip is: $115.00 (round); $65.00 (one-way). There are no additional payment processing fee charges. You may go to the <a href="tickets.html">Tickets</a> page to make a purchase.</p>
                <p><strong>How long will my trip take?</strong></p>
                <p>The travel time by bus between Cornell and Philadelphia, PA averages between 4.5 to 5.5 hours, with one rest stop for food on each trip.</p>
                <p><strong>What do I need in order to board the bus?</strong></p>
                <p>You only need your Student ID to board the bus. Please check your ticket before boarding the bus by following the link sent to your email by Autoresponder in response to any email that you sent to us. The list of riders is verified on the bus by a trip coordinator.</p>
                <p><strong>When can I expect to hear back from the Waiting List?</strong></p>
                <p>Unfortunately, we cannot predict if and when a spot will be released for you following a cancellation. You have no obligation to wait for a cancellation and can ask for a refund from the waiting list at any time. We will not assign a cancelled seat without asking you to accept it.</p>
                <p><strong>How can I get home from my stop in Philadelphia?</strong></p>
                <p>Other than getting picked up by a family member or friend, a reliable method of getting home from the city is with the SEPTA public transportation system. <a href="http://www.septa.org">SEPTA</a> can be helpful for using our bus stop at the Amtrak Train Station. The site contains a <a href="http://www.septa.org/maps/pdf/click-map.pdf">map of all SEPTA lines</a> in the city of Philadelphia. A <a href="http://www4.septa.org/welcome/airport.html">connection from PHL Airport</a> is available as well.  There are train stops at each PHL Airport terminal and the ride to Amtrak Train Station takes around 25 minutes with only one stop in between.</p>
